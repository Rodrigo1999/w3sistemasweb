  "readme": "htmlentities.js lets you deal with \"complex\" HTML entities (not just the usual '<' '>' '\"' and '&' special characters) in an elegant, JS-oriented way, on the server *and* in the browser, without dependencies.\n\n[Demo](http://alexduloz.github.io/htmlentities/demo.html)\n\n# Install\n\n## On the server\n\n`$ npm install htmlentities`\n\n`var htmlentities = require('htmlentities');`\n\n## In the browser\n\n`<script src=\"htmlentities.js\"></script>`\n\n# Methods\n\n## `.encode(string[, encoding])`\n\nReturns the encoded version of `string`. If omitted, `encoding` defaults to `UTF-8`.\n\n\n## `.decode(string[, encoding])`\n\nReturns the decoded version of `string`. If omitted, `encoding` defaults to `UTF-8`.\n\n# Encodings\n\nThe following encodings are supported:\n\n* __UTF-8__ (aliased __utf8__)\n\n\n# Notes\n\nI wrote this plugin because I needed to compare two strings: one was encoded, one wasn't. I didn't find a library that would easily let me do it. There are nice node modules, there are client-side libraries, and there are jQuery hacks. But if you want a script that is straightforward and runs both in the browser and on the server, you will probably find htmlentities.js useful.\n",
